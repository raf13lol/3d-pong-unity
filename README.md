## small rant about this lfs object bullshit

What is this mysterious LFS object? I have recieved no warning from Github Desktop 
(which originally said something about a cache object which I then deleted).


How is it not warning Github Desktop?


Sure it is only 16MB but I want the full 1GB, not like 16MB less from a mysterious thing.
